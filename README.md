## Problem Statement

This dashboard explores the impact of various factors on the mental health of students across all genders, including social media usage, sleep hours, and the work environment.

## Steps Followed

1.Load the Data: Import the dataset, a CSV file, into Power BI Desktop.

2.Data Preview: Open Power Query Editor and, in the "View" tab under the "Data Preview" section, enable the "Column Distribution," "Column Quality," and "Column Profile" options.

3.Adjust Column Profiling: Since column profiling is initially based on only 1,000 rows, switch to "Column Profiling Based on the Entire Dataset" for a comprehensive analysis.

4.Error and Empty Value Check: No errors or empty values were found in any of the columns during the profiling.

5.Pie Chart: A pie chart was added to visualize the impact of the work environment on mental health. The chart is divided into four categories: Excellent, Poor, Good, and Fair. Each category is further subdivided into Positive, Neutral, and Negative sections.

6.Stacked Area Chart: A stacked area chart was added to illustrate the relationship between social media usage hours and stress levels.

7.Line Chart: A line chart was created to demonstrate how physical activity hours affected sleep duration.

8.Matrix Table: A matrix table was added to display the count of males, females, and other genders in each age group, as well as the total count of people for each gender and age.

9.Stacked Column Chart: A stacked column chart was used to depict the effect of screen time on stress levels, categorized into Low, Medium, and High stress.
